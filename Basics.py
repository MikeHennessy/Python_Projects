In this project, I will create a finder for MLB baseball players in the American League Central Division
The players will consist of only the starting 9 of each team, the starting pitchers, and the closer
The user will input whether the player is a position player or pitcher,
which position or starter 1-5 or closer, and the team name
I will then generate the player's name and the players 2020 WAR

In another method, I will generate a random player in the AL central division
